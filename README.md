# EShop-MVC

The is my prototype project featuring an EShop with **ASP.NET MVC**. <br>
The controllers get data from context using **Entity Framework**. <br>
The whole project was created using **Code first** approach.<br>
It features custom user login using **sessions**, <br>
specific actions and pages available only on admins based on **user's type**, <br>
Users/Customers Creation - Edit - Listing, <br>
Products Creation - Edit - Listing, <br>
Order Creation - Completion - Listing, <br>
3 different ways to order based on the occasion  <br>
(Admin can make an order for every available customer, <br>
Normal user can make an order only their selves, <br>
Not registered user can make an order by filling the mandatory details for a customer) and many more.
